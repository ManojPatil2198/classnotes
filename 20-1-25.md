# what is http status 

An **HTTP status** is a code returned by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. These codes indicate whether the request was successfully completed, encountered an error, or requires additional actions. HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers grouped into five classes:

### 1xx: Informational

- **100 Continue**: The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed with the request body.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: The server agrees to switch protocols as requested by the client.

### 2xx: Success

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource was created.
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there's no content to send back.

### 3xx: Redirection

- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found**: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
- **304 Not Modified**: The cached version of the resource is still valid; no need to re-download it.

### 4xx: Client Errors

- **400 Bad Request**: The server couldn't understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required for the request.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.
- **404 Not Found**: The server can't find the requested resource.

### 5xx: Server Errors

- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered a general error and couldn't complete the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is temporarily unavailable, often due to maintenance.

# What is API

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. 
It defines how requests and responses should be structured, enabling developers to interact with software components, systems, or web services without needing to understand their internal workings.

### Key Components of an API:

1. **Endpoint**: The URL where a specific service or resource can be accessed.
2. **Request**: The information sent by the client (e.g., data and actions to perform).
3. **Response**: The data or status code sent back by the server in reply to the request.
4. **Methods**:
    - **GET**: Retrieve data.
    - **POST**: Submit new data.
    - **PUT**: Update existing data.
    - **DELETE**: Remove data.

### Types of APIs:

1. **Web APIs**: Used for communication over the web (e.g., REST, GraphQL, SOAP).
2. **Library APIs**: Expose functions or classes in a library for other programs to use.
3. **Operating System APIs**: Allow applications to interact with system hardware or software (e.g., file management).
4. **Hardware APIs**: Enable software to interact with hardware devices.

### Common Examples of APIs:

- **Social Media APIs**: Fetch or post data on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram.
- **Payment APIs**: Process payments (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- **Weather APIs**: Access weather forecasts or data.

what is query string 

A **query string** is a part of a URL that contains additional information for a web server to process a request. It is typically used to send data from the client (e.g., browser) to the server.

### Structure of a Query String:

1. **Starts with a `?`**:
    - The query string begins after the main URL and is introduced by a question mark (`?`).
2. **Contains key-value pairs**:
    - Data is passed as `key=value` pairs.
3. **Multiple pairs separated by `&`**:
    - If there are multiple parameters, they are separated by an ampersand (`&`).

### Example:

plaintext

CopyEdit

`https://example.com/search?query=shoes&size=10&color=blue`

- **Base URL**: `https://example.com/search`
- **Query string**: `?query=shoes&size=10&color=blue`
    - `query`: "shoes"
    - `size`: "10"
    - `color`: "blue"

### How Query Strings Work:

- The server processes the query string to determine what the user or application is requesting.
- The data in the query string is typically parsed on the server side for use in the response.

### Use Cases:

1. **Search Parameters**: Sending search terms (`?query=shoes`).
2. **Filtering/Sorting**: Applying filters or sort orders (`?sort=price&filter=available`).
3. **Pagination**: Navigating through results (`?page=2&limit=20`).

### Limitations:

- **Length**: Most browsers have a limit on the maximum URL length, which includes the query string.
- **Security**: Query strings are visible in the URL, so they shouldn't include sensitive data like passwords.

# what is headers in api


In the context of APIs, **headers** are key-value pairs included in the request or response that provide additional information about the request or response.
Headers are part of the HTTP protocol and help define how the client and server should interact. They can carry metadata, authentication tokens, content type information, and more.

### Types of Headers

Headers can appear in both **HTTP requests** (sent by the client) and **HTTP responses** (sent by the server).

#### 1. **Request Headers** (from client to server):

Provide details about the client or the request itself. Examples:

- **Authorization**: Sends credentials or tokens for secure access.
    - Example: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **Content-Type**: Specifies the format of the request body (e.g., JSON, XML).
    - Example: `Content-Type: application/json`
- **User-Agent**: Provides information about the client (browser, app, etc.).
    - Example: `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0`
- **Accept**: Specifies the types of content the client can process.
    - Example: `Accept: application/json`

#### 2. **Response Headers** (from server to client):

Provide details about the server or the response data. Examples:

- **Content-Type**: Indicates the format of the response body.
    - Example: `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Cache-Control**: Specifies caching policies for the client.
    - Example: `Cache-Control: no-cache`
- **Set-Cookie**: Sends cookies to the client for session management.
    - Example: `Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123`

### Why Headers Are Important:

1. **Authentication**: Using headers like `Authorization` to securely send API tokens or credentials.
2. **Content Negotiation**: Indicating or selecting the format of data (e.g., JSON or XML).
3. **Session Management**: Cookies and other session details can be passed in headers.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Headers like `Cache-Control` and `ETag` help improve performance by managing caching.

### Example API Request with Headers:

plaintext

CopyEdit

`GET /api/users HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Authorization: Bearer abc123 Content-Type: application/json Accept: application/json`

### Example API Response with Headers:

plaintext

CopyEdit

`HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json Cache-Control: no-cache Server: Apache/2.4.41`
