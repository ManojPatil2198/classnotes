# What is Radies?


#### **1. Introduction to Redis**

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an **open-source, in-memory data structure store** that can be used as a **database, cache, and message broker**. It is known for its **high performance, low latency, and scalability**, making it a popular choice for applications that require fast data access.

- **Developer**: Originally developed by Salvatore Sanfilippo in 2009.
- **License**: BSD License.
- **Written in**: C programming language.
- **Official Website**: [redis.io](https://redis.io/)

#### **2. Features of Redis**

Redis offers several key features that differentiate it from traditional relational and NoSQL databases:

1. **In-Memory Storage**:
    
    - Redis stores data in **RAM** instead of disk, allowing for lightning-fast read and write operations.
    - This makes it suitable for caching, session management, and real-time applications.
2. **Data Persistence**:
    
    - Although it is an in-memory store, Redis provides **durability** through:
        - **RDB (Redis Database Backup)**: Periodic snapshots of the dataset.
        - **AOF (Append-Only File)**: Logs all write operations for recovery.
3. **Rich Data Structures**:
    
    - Unlike simple key-value stores, Redis supports multiple **data types**:
        - **Strings**: Basic text or binary data.
        - **Lists**: Ordered collections, useful for messaging queues.
        - **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique values.
        - **Sorted Sets (ZSets)**: Similar to sets, but with a score for ranking.
        - **Hashes**: Key-value pairs within a key (like JSON objects).
        - **Bitmaps & HyperLogLogs**: Used for efficient bitwise operations and approximations.
4. **High Performance**:
    
    - Redis is **single-threaded but highly optimized**, capable of processing **millions of requests per second**.
    - Uses **non-blocking I/O** and an **event-driven model**.
5. **Replication & Clustering**:
    
    - **Master-Slave Replication**: Redis can replicate data across multiple instances for **high availability**.
    - **Redis Cluster**: Provides **automatic partitioning (sharding)** for horizontal scalability.
6. **Pub/Sub Messaging**:
    
    - Redis supports **publish-subscribe (Pub/Sub) messaging**, useful for **real-time applications** like chat systems, notifications, and event streaming.
7. **Transactions & Lua Scripting**:
    
    - Supports **Atomic Transactions** using the `MULTI` and `EXEC` commands.
    - **Lua Scripting** allows executing complex logic inside Redis without multiple network requests.
8. **Security & Authentication**:
    
    - **ACL (Access Control Lists)** for managing user permissions.
    - Supports **TLS encryption** and authentication with passwords.

#### **3. How Redis Works**

1. **Client Sends a Request**: A client (application) sends a command to the Redis server.
2. **Processing in Memory**: Redis retrieves or updates the requested data directly from RAM.
3. **Response to Client**: The result is sent back almost instantly.

#### **4. Use Cases of Redis**

1. **Caching**: Speeds up application performance by storing frequently accessed data.
2. **Session Management**: Used for managing user sessions in web applications.
3. **Real-time Analytics**: Tracks counters, leaderboards, and other metrics.
4. **Message Queues**: Handles background jobs and event processing.
5. **Geospatial Applications**: Stores and queries location-based data.

# what is message broker ?
# **Message Broker: In-Depth Explanation**

## **1. Introduction to Message Broker**

A **message broker** is a software system that facilitates communication between applications, services, or systems by **transmitting, routing, and managing messages**. 
It acts as a **middleware** that ensures reliable message delivery, even if the sender and receiver are not directly connected or available at the same time.

### **Key Functions of a Message Broker:**

- **Decouples** communication between services.
- **Ensures reliable message delivery** even in case of failures.
- **Supports asynchronous messaging** for scalable architectures.
- **Provides message transformation** (if needed).
- **Manages message routing and filtering.**

---

## **2. How a Message Broker Works**

### **Basic Workflow:**

1. **Producer (Sender) Sends a Message**
    - An application (producer) generates and sends a message to the message broker.
2. **Message Broker Receives & Processes the Message**
    - The broker stores, transforms, or routes the message.
3. **Consumer (Receiver) Retrieves the Message**
    - The consumer application reads the message and processes it.

### **Example:**

- An **e-commerce website** sends an "order placed" message to a broker.
- The broker routes the message to **inventory, payment, and shipping services**.
- Each service processes its part **independently**.

---

## **3. Types of Message Brokers**

### **A. Point-to-Point (Queue-based) Model**

- Uses **message queues** where messages are **stored** until a receiver consumes them.
- Once a message is **processed**, it is **removed** from the queue.
- Ensures **only one consumer processes a message**.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**

- A job processing system where multiple workers process tasks in a queue.
- **Popular Message Brokers**: RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, Amazon SQS.

---

### **B. Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) Model**

- Messages are **published** to a **topic**.
- Multiple **subscribers** receive the message.
- Ensures **real-time communication**.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:**

- A **news alert system** where multiple users receive the same breaking news update.
- **Popular Message Brokers**: Redis Pub/Sub, Apache Kafka, Google Pub/Sub.

# What is NVM ? 

## **1. Introduction to NVM**

**NVM (Node Version Manager)** is a tool that allows developers to easily install, manage, and switch between multiple **Node.js** versions on a single system. It is particularly useful for developers working on different projects that require different versions of Node.js.

- **Official Repository**: [GitHub - NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- **Supported Platforms**: Linux, macOS, and Windows (via `nvm-windows`).

---

## **2. Why Use NVM?**

### âœ… **Multiple Node.js Versions**

- Different projects may require different versions of **Node.js**.
- NVM lets you install and switch between versions easily.

### âœ… **Easy Upgrades & Downgrades**

- Quickly switch between **old** and **new** versions of Node.js for testing.

### âœ… **Per-Project Node.js Versioning**

- Set a **default version** for different projects, avoiding compatibility issues.

### âœ… **Avoiding Global Conflicts**

- If you install Node.js globally, it might conflict with project dependencies.
- With NVM, different versions can be used **without affecting system-wide settings**.

---

## **3. How NVM Works**

### **Basic Concept**

- NVM **manages Node.js installations** by storing multiple versions in a specific directory.
- When you switch versions, it updates your environment variables **dynamically**.

---

## **4. How to Install NVM**

### **On Linux/macOS**

#### **Step 1: Download & Install**

Run the following command in your terminal:

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash`

(Replace `v0.39.5` with the latest version if needed.)

#### **Step 2: Restart the Terminal**

`source ~/.bashrc   # For Bash users source ~/.zshrc    # For Zsh users`

#### **Step 3: Verify Installation**

`nvm --version`

If installed correctly, it will output the installed **NVM version**.

---

### **On Windows (NVM for Windows)**

#### **Step 1: Download the Windows Installer**

- Visit: [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
- Download the latest `.exe` file and install it.

#### **Step 2: Verify Installation**

`nvm version`

---

## **5. Basic NVM Commands**

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`nvm install <version>`|Installs a specific Node.js version (e.g., `nvm install 18.17.0`)|
|`nvm list`|Lists all installed Node.js versions|
|`nvm use <version>`|Switches to a specific Node.js version|
|`nvm alias default <version>`|Sets a default Node.js version|
|`nvm uninstall <version>`|Removes a specific Node.js version|
|`nvm current`|Shows the currently active Node.js version|

---

## **6. Example Usage**

### **Install Node.js Versions**

`nvm install 16 nvm install 18 nvm install 20`

This installs **Node.js versions 16, 18, and 20**.

### **Switch Between Versions**

`nvm use 18`

Now, **Node.js v18** is active.

### **Check Installed Versions**

`nvm list`

Example output:

`v16.14.2 v18.17.0 v20.4.0`

### **Set a Default Node.js Version**

`nvm alias default 18`

Every new terminal session will now use **Node.js 18**.

---

## **7. Using NVM with Specific Projects**

If your project requires **Node.js 16**, create an `.nvmrc` file in the project directory:

`echo "16" > .nvmrc`

Then, run:

`nvm use`

NVM will automatically switch to **Node.js 16** whenever you enter that project directory.

---

## **8. Uninstalling NVM**

### **On Linux/macOS**

Run:

`rm -rf ~/.nvm`

Remove NVM lines from `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` and restart your terminal.

### **On Windows**

- Open "Add or Remove Programs" and uninstall "NVM for Windows".
- Delete the NVM directory (`C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\nvm`).
