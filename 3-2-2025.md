# What is memory leak


A **memory leak** happens when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations, leading to unused memory not being released. Over time, this can cause excessive memory consumption, slowing down the system and potentially causing crashes.

### **Causes of Memory Leaks**

1. **Failure to Free Memory** – When a program allocates memory (e.g., using `malloc` in C or `new` in C++) but never releases it (`free` or `delete`), it remains occupied.
2. **Dangling References** – If objects are no longer needed but still have references, the garbage collector (in languages like Java, Python) won’t reclaim them.
3. **Global or Static Variables Holding References** – If global variables retain references to objects, the memory won’t be freed until the program ends.
4. **Event Listeners Not Removed** – In languages like JavaScript, event listeners attached to elements that are removed from the DOM can cause memory to linger.
5. **Unclosed File or Network Handles** – Open files, sockets, or database connections that are not properly closed can lead to memory leaks.

### **Effects of Memory Leaks**

- **Increased RAM Usage** – Over time, the program consumes more and more memory.
- **Performance Degradation** – The system may slow down as it struggles to allocate more memory.
- **Application Crashes** – Eventually, the system may run out of memory, causing crashes.

### **Preventing Memory Leaks**

- **Manually Free Memory** – In languages like C/C++, always pair `malloc` with `free`, and `new` with `delete`.
- **Use Smart Pointers** – In C++, using `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` helps manage memory automatically.
- **Monitor References** – In languages with garbage collection, avoid keeping unnecessary references.
- **Close Resources** – Ensure files, database connections, and sockets are closed after use.
- **Use Memory Profiling Tools** – Tools like Valgrind (for C/C++), VisualVM (for Java), and Chrome DevTools (for JavaScript) help detect leaks.

 what is key API
An **API key** is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or application when accessing an **Application Programming Interface (API)**. It acts as a security token that allows a system to verify the legitimacy of a request.

### **Purpose of an API Key**

- **Authentication** – Ensures only authorized users or applications can access the API.
- **Access Control** – Determines what level of data or functionality a user can access.
- **Usage Tracking** – Monitors API requests to track usage, prevent abuse, or enforce rate limits.

### **How an API Key Works**

1. A developer **registers** with an API provider and receives a unique API key.
2. The API key is **included** in API requests (usually in the header or as a query parameter).
3. The server **validates** the key before allowing access.

### **Example of an API Key in Use**

A request to a weather API with an API key:

https://api.weather.com/data?location=NewYork&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY`

# What is cache

A cache is a temporary storage area that holds frequently accessed data to make future requests faster. It helps improve performance by reducing the need to fetch data repeatedly from slower sources like databases or remote servers.

### **How Does Caching Work?**

1. When a system requests data, it first checks if it's available in the **cache**.
2. If the data is **found (cache hit)**, it's retrieved quickly.
3. If the data is **not found (cache miss)**, it is fetched from the original source and then stored in the cache for future use.

### **Types of Caching**

🔹 **Browser Cache** – Stores website files (images, scripts) locally to speed up page loading.  
🔹 **Server Cache** – Web servers cache dynamic content to reduce processing time.  
🔹 **Database Cache** – Frequently used queries are stored to minimize database load.  
🔹 **Memory Cache** – Tools like **Redis** or **Memcached** store temporary data in RAM for fast access.

### **Benefits of Caching**

✅ **Faster performance** – Reduces load times for applications and websites.  
✅ **Lower server load** – Decreases the number of requests to backend servers.  
✅ **Better user experience** – Reduces lag in applications.

# What is contract testing

**Contract testing** is a type of software testing that ensures that two systems (such as a client and a server, or microservices) can communicate correctly by verifying that they adhere to a shared contract. This contract defines the structure, expected inputs, and outputs of their interactions.

---

### **Why is Contract Testing Important?**

In modern applications, especially those using **microservices, APIs, or third-party services**, contract testing helps ensure that:  
✅ Services remain compatible after updates.  
✅ Unexpected changes in API responses don’t break dependent systems.  
✅ Testing is faster and more reliable than full integration testing.

---

### **How Does Contract Testing Work?**

1. **Define a Contract** – The consumer (client) specifies expected request/response formats.
2. **Validate Provider Responses** – The provider (API/microservice) ensures it matches the expected contract.
3. **Automate Testing** – Tools like **Pact, Spring Cloud Contract, or Contractest** automate verification.

---

### **Example Scenario**

Imagine a **frontend app** (consumer) requesting user data from a **backend API** (provider).

- The frontend expects:
    
   `{   "id": 1,   "name": "John Doe" }`
    
- The backend must ensure it always provides this format.

If the backend changes the response structure (e.g., renaming `"name"` to `"fullName"`), contract testing **catches the issue early** before it breaks the frontend.

---

### **Contract Testing vs. Other Testing Types**

|**Testing Type**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|
|**Unit Testing**|Tests individual functions or methods.|
|**Integration Testing**|Tests interactions between multiple components.|
|**Contract Testing**|Ensures that services communicate correctly based on an agreed contract.|
|**End-to-End Testing**|Tests the entire application flow from start to finish.|

# what is database schema

A **database schema** is the **structured blueprint** of how data is organized within a database.
 It defines **tables, columns, data types, relationships, constraints, indexes, and other database elements**.

---

### **Types of Database Schemas**

1️⃣ **Physical Schema** – Defines how data is stored at the hardware level (e.g., disk partitions, indexing, storage engines).

2️⃣ **Logical Schema** – Defines the **structure of tables, relationships, and constraints** without focusing on physical storage.

3️⃣ **View Schema** – Represents **virtual tables** created using queries (e.g., SQL **Views** for reporting).

---

### **Key Components of a Database Schema**

🔹 **Tables** – Define how data is stored (e.g., `Users`, `Orders`, `Products`).  
🔹 **Columns & Data Types** – Define fields and data types (e.g., `id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255)`).  
🔹 **Keys** –

- **Primary Key (PK)** – Uniquely identifies each row.
- **Foreign Key (FK)** – Creates relationships between tables.  
    🔹 **Indexes** – Improve query performance.  
    🔹 **Constraints** – Enforce rules like `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`.

---

### **Example of a Database Schema (SQL)**

CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);

🔹 **Users Table** – Stores user details.  
🔹 **Orders Table** – Stores order details with a **foreign key** linking to `Users`.
